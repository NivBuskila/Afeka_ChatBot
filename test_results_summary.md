# Test Results Summary

## Overview
We attempted to run tests for all components of the Afeka ChatBot project. This document summarizes our findings.

## Backend Tests
- **Structure**: Tests are located in `/tests/backend/` directory with separate folders for API and integration tests
- **Test Files**:
  - API tests: `/tests/backend/api/test_api.py`, `test_documents.py`, `test_error_handling.py`, `test_proxy.py`
  - Integration tests: `/tests/backend/integration/test_integration.py`
- **Test Status**: Failed to run due to import issues
- **Issue**: The project seems to be designed to run in a Docker environment with specific module paths
- **Recommendation**: Use Docker to run these tests as intended in the project structure

## Frontend Tests
- **Structure**: Tests are located in `/tests/frontend/components/` directory
- **Test Files**: 
  - Component tests: `ThemeToggle.test.tsx`, `Settings.test.tsx`, `Reference.test.tsx`, `ChatMessage.test.tsx`, `ChatInput.test.tsx`, `ChatHistory.test.tsx`, `ChatContainer.test.tsx`, `Chat.test.tsx`
- **Test Status**: Failed to run due to Vitest configuration issues
- **Issue**: The frontend tests depend on Vitest being correctly installed and configured
- **Recommendation**: Run the tests inside the Docker environment or set up the proper Node.js environment locally

## AI Tests
- **Structure**: Tests directory exists at `/tests/ai/` but appears to be empty except for a `.gitkeep` file
- **Status**: No tests to run
- **Recommendation**: Implement tests for AI components if needed

## Docker Environment
- **Status**: Docker Desktop was not running correctly on the system
- **Recommendation**: Start Docker Desktop and run the tests inside the containerized environment, which is how the project is designed to be tested

## Next Steps
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running properly
2. Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` to start all services
3. Run the tests inside the respective Docker containers using:
   ```
   # For backend tests
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run backend-test
   
   # For frontend tests
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run frontend-test
   ```

## Conclusion
The project has a comprehensive test setup across different layers (backend, frontend, integration) but requires the proper Docker environment to run as designed. Manual testing of individual components is possible but requires significant setup to match the expected project structure.
